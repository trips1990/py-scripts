python scripts

The idea is to automate the configuration of IBM/Lenevo IMM, specific to M4/M5 servers.

Instructions:
1. Type all the imm ips into host-list.txt file
2. Type all the hostnames in host-name.txt file in same order as the ips are inserted in host-list.txt
3. copy the script, give it executable permission and then execute it.

Let me know if you face any issue.
